Google-Home Page
In this project, we are going to see a basic Html and CSS code trying to copy how the google main page looks like.
The skills that we are using for developing this project are:
1. Two ways to move a div around on the page
2. Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
3. Identify the background color of an existing web page
4. Grab the URL for an image from an existing web page
5. Center an element horizontally
6. Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
7. Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
8. Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
